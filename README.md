# BattleBrain
Developed an Android application using Kotlin that allows users to choose and play from three classic games: Quiz Trivia, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and Tic-Tac-Toe. The app features a simple and intuitive interface where the user selects the desired game from a main menu. Each game is designed to be interactive and engaging, with logic implemented to provide a smooth user experience. This project demonstrates my understanding of Kotlin, UI design, activity navigation, and game logic implementation in Android development.
